# Landing Page Project

Welcome to my first landing page project! This simple web page showcases my skills in HTML and CSS and consists of three main sections: "About," "Motivational Quote," and "Say Hi."

**NOTE**
This Landing page is not responsive it only works on Desktop till now but i'll make it responsive ASAP when i'll learn responsiveness

## Table of Contents
- [About](#about)
- [Motivational Quote](#motivation)
- [Say Hi](#say-hi)

## About
The "About" section provides some dummy cards where you'll watch some of my projects (these projects don't exists they're just dummy cards)

## Motivational Quote
The "Motivational Quote" section displays an inspirational quote. You can change the quote and its source in the HTML/CSS to match your preferences or theme.

## Say Hi
The "Say Hi" section contains a button and when you hover, it shows some kind of transition. it doesn't send msg in real. It's just dummy.
